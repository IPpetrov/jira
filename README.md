# Jira Task Filter (Flask App)

A simple internal Flask app that helps with advanced Jira filtering â€” specifically cases where Jira's JQL falls short.

### What It Does

- Lets you filter and view Jira tickets that meet more complex conditions
- Example use case: find all main tickets where **all linked tasks are resolved**, so the main ticket can be closed
- Intended to make life easier when working with large Jira boards or BAU queues

### Tech Stack

- **Python** + **Flask** for the web app
- **Jira REST API** for pulling ticket data
- **Docker** for easy packaging
- **Google Cloud Run** for serverless deployment
